# Grocery-Store
A program that lets the user add items to their cart and then purchase those items.

To use this program, open up the project in Microsoft Visual Studio or open the exectuable file that is in
/GroceryStore/GroceryStore/GroceryStore/bin/Release/.

This program lets you add store items to your cart, move those items back into the store if you don't want them, and purchase the
items in your cart. It tells you your balance, the price of all the items, and the price of all the items with tax included.
